# 🗄️ Database Documentation

## 📊 Overview

This document outlines the database structure and management for the NFL Game Ticket System. We use PostgreSQL as our relational database management system, with Flyway for version-controlled database migrations.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **PostgreSQL** 13: Our primary database system
- **Flyway**: For managing database migrations
- **Docker**: For containerization and consistent environments

## 🔄 Migration Strategy

We use Flyway for database migrations, following these conventions:

1. Migration files are named: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS__description.sql`
2. Migrations are version-controlled alongside the application code
3. Both schema changes and data migrations are managed through Flyway

Example migration file: `20241010174001__create_initial_schema.sql`

## 🔐 Data Integrity

We maintain data integrity through:

1. Foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity
2. NOT NULL constraints on essential fields
3. UNIQUE constraints where applicable (e.g., `games.event_id`)
4. Check constraints for enum-like fields (e.g., `games.status`)

## 🔄 Synchronization Support

The schema is designed to support efficient synchronization with Ticketmaster:

1. The `event_id` field in the `games` table corresponds to Ticketmaster's event ID
2. The `updated_at` timestamp allows for tracking of last-updated times

## 🚀 Scalability Considerations

As the dataset grows, consider:

1. Partitioning the `games` table by date range
2. Implementing a caching layer for frequently accessed data
